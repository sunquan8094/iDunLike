## Installation
1. Clone this repository in your terminal. I assume you know how to clone a GitHub repository by now.
2. As stated beforehand, this is a Chrome extension. So, open up Chrome and navigate to Extensions.
3. Yay, you're at the Extensions panel! Enable developer mode by checking the checkbox. If you already have it checked, good for you.
4. Click on "Load unpacked extension", select the folder your cloned repository is stored under, and click "Open".

## Usage
Click on Options for this plugin in the Extensions panel. \(You should know how to get there by now.\) Choose some keywords of topics that make you cringe or smile with delight. For those keywords that make you cringe, enter them on the left side. For those keywords that make you smile with delight, enter on the right side. Don't forget to save!
