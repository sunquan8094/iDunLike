# iDunLike
Make your news feed great again with iDunLike, a homemade Chrome and Firefox extension which filters posts wherever you are on Facebook according to your tastes.

## Features
Here is a list of the current features:
* filtering of unwanted posts using regular expressions
* prioritizing of desired posts using regular expressions
* optional desired regex hierarchy
* regex optimizer (it is a rather quick and dirty one)

## In the Works
* package system \(ideas for default packages welcome\)
* options page inteface

## Installation
1. Clone this repository in your terminal. I assume you know how to clone a GitHub repository by now.
2. Navigate to the folder that says iDunLike plus the name of your browser, then follow the instructions below:
* Chrome Instructions
    - Open up Chrome and navigate to Extensions.
    - Yay, you're at the Extensions panel! Enable developer mode by checking the checkbox. If you already have it checked, good for you.
  	- Click on "Load unpacked extension", select the folder your cloned repository is stored under, and click "Open".
* Firefox Instructions
    - You're going to have to run this extension in Firefox Developer Edition using the `web-ext` tool. Instructions for installing the `web-ext` tool can be found [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Getting_started_with_web-ext). Run `web-ext run --firefox-binary=/Applications/FirefoxDeveloperEdition.app/` on OS X or `web-ext run --firefox-binary="C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\firefox.exe"` on Windows. If not, you can  install it on your own. Search for it using your favorite search engine.

## Usage
Click on Options for this plugin in the Extensions panel. \(You should know how to get there by now.\) Choose some keywords of topics that make you cringe or smile with delight. For those keywords that make you cringe, enter them on the left side. For those keywords that make you smile with delight, enter on the right side. Don't forget to save!
